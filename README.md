New Year's Eve Countdown Timer
===============

Pygame-powered New Year's Eve countdown timer. Wrote it so we'd have something reasonable on-screen in the living room at our NYE 2014 party.

Requires the TTF versions of [Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html) in the local directory. An optional `bgimage.jpg` can be provided too.
